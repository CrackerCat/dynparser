//! Here it's the peg grammar to parse the peg input  ;-P
//!
//! There is also a function to print the rust source code
//!
//! It's used in order to develop myself
//!
//! A parser for the parser (you know)
//!
//! To generate the code to parse the peg, you just have to run...
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate dynparser;
//! use dynparser::peg::peg2code;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     peg2code::print_rules2parse_peg();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! And the result, has to be pasted in peg::rules.rs
//!
