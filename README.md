A small and simple Dynamic Parser. It's not a compile time parser.

You can create and modify the grammar on runtime.

A parser is something that takes an `input`, process it with some `rules`
and generate an `AST`

![simple_parser](./doc_images/simple_parser.png "Simple parser")

In order to create the grammar, you can build a set of rules, or you can use
macros to use a better syntax. But, the easier way, is to use a `peg` grammar.

Then we need an additional step.

![basic_diagram](./doc_images/basic.png "Basic diagram")

More info about the `peg` syntax bellow.

You can also generate `rust` code from rules generated from `peg`.

This allow you to avoid the `peg` step and more...

In fact, in order to use a `peg` grammar, you have to parse it.
How to parse a `peg` grammar? Well, this is a parser, therefore...

More details about it bellow on section (parsing the parser)

## Usage

Add to `cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
dynparser = "0.2.0"
```

Watch examples below

## Modifications

    0.1.0   First version
    0.2.0   Fixed some errors
            Rules code for peg parsing generated automatically from peg

## TODO

- pass_throw except ast
- Not consumed full input
- eof
- replace " by ' on literals

```ignore
    let peg = r#"
    main    =   "hello" " "  "world"
            /   "hola"
            /   "hola"  " "  "mundo"

        "#,
    ).map_err(|e| {
        println!("{}", e);
        panic!("FAIL");
    })
        .unwrap();

    println!("{:#?}", rules);

    let result = parse("hola mundo", &rules);
```

- calculator parser example
- add errors to grammar
- Move to an external crate IVector
- apply tail recursion parsing rule
- macro for eof
- rules path on errors configurable (due to performance)
  - check. is it interesting to detail branches on or?

## Basic example

Lets create the next grammar:

```ignore
    main            =   letter letter_or_num+

    letter          =   [a-zA-Z]

    letter_or_num   =   letter
                    /   number

    number          =   [0-9]
```

This grammar will accept a letter, followed from one or more letters or
numbers

### Just from peg

![basic_diagram](./doc_images/basic.png "Basic diagram")

Straightforward...

```rust
    extern crate dynparser;
    use dynparser::{parse, rules_from_peg};

    fn main() {
        let rules = rules_from_peg(
            r#"

    main            =   letter letter_or_num+

    letter          =   [a-zA-Z]

    letter_or_num   =   letter
                    /   number

    number          =   [0-9]

            "#,
        ).unwrap();

        assert!(parse("a2AA456bzJ88", &rules).is_ok());
    }
```

If you want to print more information...

```rust
    extern crate dynparser;
    use dynparser::{parse, rules_from_peg};

    fn main() {
        let rules = rules_from_peg(
            r#"

    main            =   letter letter_or_num+

    letter          =   [a-zA-Z]

    letter_or_num   =   letter
                    /   number

    number          =   [0-9]

            "#,
        ).map_err(|e| {
            println!("{}", e);
            panic!("FAIL");
        })
            .unwrap();

        println!("{:#?}", rules);

        let result = parse("a2Z", &rules);
        match result {
            Ok(ast) => println!("{:#?}", ast),
            Err(e) => println!("Error: {:?}", e),
        };
    }
```

The AST produced will be:

```peg
Rule(
    (
        "main",
        [
            Rule(
                (
                    "letter",
                    [
                        Val(
                            "a"
                        )
                    ]
                )
            ),
            Rule(
                (
                    "letter_or_num",
                    [
                        Rule(
                            (
                                "number",
                                [
                                    Val(
                                        "2"
                                    )
                                ]
                            )
                        )
                    ]
                )
            ),
            Rule(
                (
                    "letter_or_num",
                    [
                        Rule(
                            (
                                "letter",
                                [
                                    Val(
                                        "Z"
                                    )
                                ]
                            )
                        )
                    ]
                )
            )
        ]
    )
)
```

The AST type is:

```rust
pub enum Node {
    Val(String),
    Rule((String, Vec<Node>)),
    EOF,
}
```

Just it (remember, more information about the peg grammar bellow)

## Example 2

You will configure a set of rules to parse.

The rule is composed of a name followed by an arrow and an expression to be parsed.

A basic example

Lets create the next grammar:

```ignore
   main    =   "a" ( "bc" "c"
                   / "bcdd"
                   / b_and_c  d_or_z
                   )

   b_and_c =   "b" "c"
   d_or_z  =   "d" / "z"
```

### Just from peg

```rust
extern crate dynparser;
use dynparser::{parse, rules_from_peg};

fn main() {
    let rules = rules_from_peg(
        r#"

    main    =   "a" ( "bc" "c"
                    / "bcdd"
                    / b_and_c  d_or_z
                    )

    b_and_c =   "b" "c"
    d_or_z  =   "d" / "z"

        "#,
    ).unwrap();

    assert!(parse("abcz", &rules).is_ok());
    assert!(parse("abcdd", &rules).is_ok());
    assert!(parse("abcc", &rules).is_ok());
    assert!(parse("bczd", &rules).is_err());
}
```

The exit will be the next AST

```ignore
   Rule(
       (
           "main",
           [
               Val(
                   "a"
               ),
               Rule(
                   (
                       "b_and_c",
                       [
                           Val(
                               "b"
                           ),
                           Val(
                               "c"
                           )
                       ]
                   )
               ),
               Rule(
                   (
                       "d_or_z",
                       [
                           Val(
                               "d"
                           )
                       ]
                   )
               )
           ]
       )
   )
```

This is a dynamic parser, you can add rules at execution time.

pending: example

### Generating the rules by hand with macros

You can create this grammar and parse the string "abcd" with macros like:

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate dynparser;
use dynparser::parse;

fn main() {
    let rules = rules!{
       "main"   =>  and!{
                        lit!("a"),
                        or!(
                            and!(lit!("bc"), lit!("c")),
                            lit!("bcdd"),
                            and!(
                                ref_rule!("b_and_c"),
                                ref_rule!("d_or_z")
                            )
                        )
                    },
        "b_and_c"  => and!(lit!("b"), lit!("c")),
        "d_or_z"  => or!(lit!("d"), lit!("z"))
    };

    let result = parse("abcd", &rules);
    match result {
        Ok(ast) => println!("{:#?}", ast),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {:?}", e),
    };
}
```

Adding a rule on execution time:

```rust
#[macro_use]  extern crate dynparser;
use dynparser::parse;
fn main() {
    let rules = rules!{
       "main"   =>  and!{
                        rep!(lit!("a"), 1, 5),
                        ref_rule!("rule2")
                    }
    };

    let rules = rules.add("rule2", lit!("bcd"));

    assert!(parse("aabcd", &rules).is_ok())
}
```

Of course, you could need to add (or merge) several rules at once

And of course, you can add several rules at once

```rust
#[macro_use]  extern crate dynparser;
use dynparser::parse;
fn main() {
    let r = rules!{
       "main"   =>  and!{
                        rep!(lit!("a"), 1, 5),
                        ref_rule!("rule2")
                    }
    };
    let r = r.merge(rules!{"rule2" => lit!("bcd")});
    assert!(parse("aabcd", &r).is_ok())
}
```

`merge` takes the ownership of both set of rules and returns a "new" (in fact modified)
set of rules. This helps to reduce mutability

"main" rule is the entry point.

## PEG

### Rule elements enumeration

Examples below

| token    | Description                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `=`      | On left, symbol, on right expresion defining symbol    |
| `symbol` | It's an string without quotes                          |
| `.`      | Any char                                               |
| `"..."`  | Literal delimited by quotes                            |
| `space`  | Separate tokens and Rule concatenation (and operation) |
| `/`      | Or operation                                           |
| `(...)`  | A expression composed of sub expresions                |
| `?`      | One optional                                           |
| `*`      | Repeat 0 or more                                       |
| `+`      | Repeat 1 or more                                       |
| `!`      | negate expression                                      |
| `[...]`  | Match chars. It's a list or ranges (or both)           |
| `->`     | pending...                                             |
| `:`      | pending...                                             |

Let's see by example

#### Rules by example

A simple literal string.

```peg
main = "Hello world"
```

Concatenation (and)

```peg
main = "Hello "  "world"
```

Referencing symbols (rule)

Symbol

```peg
main = hi
hi   = "Hello world"
```

Or `/`

```peg
main = "hello" / "hi"
```

Or multiline

```peg
main
    = "hello"
    / "hi"
    / "hola"
```

Or multiline 2

```peg
main = "hello"
     / "hi"
     / "hola"
```

Or disorganized

```peg
main = "hello"
     / "hi" / "hola"
```

Parenthesis

```peg
main = ("hello" / "hi")  " world"
```

Just multiline

Multiline1

```peg
main
    = ("hello" / "hi")  " world"
```

Multiline2

```peg
main
    = ("hello" / "hi")
    " world"
```

Multiline3

```peg
main = ("hello" / "hi")
     " world"
```

It is recomended to use or operator `/` on each new line and `=` on first line, like

Multiline organized

```peg
main = ("hello" / "hi")  " world"
     / "bye"
```

One optional

```peg
main = ("hello" / "hi")  " world"?
```

Repetitions

```peg
main         = one_or_more_a / zero_or_many_b
one_or_more  = "a"+
zero_or_many = "b"*
```

Negation will not move current possition

Next example will consume all chars till get an "a"

Negation

```peg
main = (!"a" .)* "a"
```

Consume till

```peg
comment = "//" (!"\n" .)*
        / "/*" (!"*/" .)* "*/"
```

Match a set of chars.
Chars can be defined by range.

```peg
number  = digit+ ("." digit+)?
digit   = [0-9]
a_or_b  = [ab]
id      = [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*

a_or_b_or_digit  = [ab0-9]
```

Simple recursion

one or more "a" recursive

```peg
as  = "a" as
    / "a"

//  simplified with `+`
ak = "a"+
```

Recursion to match parenthesis

Recursion match par

```peg
match_par = "(" match_par ")"
          / "(" ")"
```

That's ok and works fine, but we can inprove error messages...

In order to improve error messages, would be interesting to modify the grammar.

Look this code:

```ignore
pending...
```

At the beggining it finished with no errors, but not consuming the hole input.
Wich is an error.

Showing an error informing that we didn't consume full input, is not the best.

```ignore
pending...
```

The reason is on

```peg
pending...
...
and_expr        =   compl_expr  (  " "  _  and_expr)*
...
```

Here, we said, "hey, try to look for a sequence, or not `*`"

And is not, then the parser say, I matched the rule, I have to continue verifying other
previus branches. But there are no previus partial applied brunchs.
Then the parser ends not consuming all the input.

To improve error messages, would be interesting to have something like:

```peg
pending...
parenth_expr    = "(" * expr _ ")"
                / "(" _ expr _ -> error("mismatch parenthesis")
```

The or brunch will be executed if there is no closing parenthesis and we can
write an specific error message.

Full grammar in peg formar bellow (a grammar for the grammar)...

## Text

Hey, I'm a text parser, I need a text to parse ;-P

If you want to parse text indentation sensitive, I recomend you the lib
[indentation_flattener](https://github.com/jleahred/indentation_flattener)

```ignore
pending...
```

## A grammar for the grammar

A grammar to define the grammar to be parsed by de parser. ;-P

I will define the grammar using the this parser grammar definition rules.

A grammar is a set of rules.

A rule, is a symbol followed by `=` and an expression

```peg
grammar = rule+
rule    = symbol "="  expr
```

Here we relax the verification to keep the grammar as simple as possible.
It's missing also the non significant spaces.

About the expression.

As you know, it's important to accept valid inputs, but also it's important to
build an AST with proper pritority.

Next grammar:

```peg
main    =  "A" "B"  /  "B" "C"
```

It's equivalent to:

```peg
main    =  ("A" "B")  /  ("B" "C")
```

But not to:

```peg
main    =  (("A" "B")  /  "B") "C"
```

To represent this priority, the expression rule has to be defined in a descendant priority way:

```peg
expr            =   or_expr

or_expr         =   and_expr     ("/"  or_expr)*

and_expr        =   simpl_expr   (" "  and_expr)*

simpl_expr      =   "!" atom_or_par
                /   simpl_par ("*" / "+")

atom_or_par     =   (atom / parenth_expr)


parenth_expr    =   "("  expr ")"
```

Descendant definition

| expr        | Description                                                                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| atom_or_par | It's an atom or a parenthesis experssion                                                 |
| rep_or_neg  | It's not a composition of `and` or `or` expressions. It can have negation or repetitions |
| parenth     | It's an expressions with parenthesis                                                     |
| and         | Sequence of expressions separated by space                                               |
| or          | Sequence of expression separated by "/"                                                  |

Now, it's the `atom` turn:

```peg
atom    =   literal
        /   match
        /   dot
        /   symbol

literal =   "\""  (!"\"" .)*  "\""
match   =   "["  ((.  "-"  .)  /  (.))+   "]"
dot     =   "."
symbol  =   [a-zA-Z0-9_]+
```

Hey, what about comments?

What about non significative spaces and carry return?

It will be defined on "\_" symbol

This is the general idea. The peg used by the parser will envolve to add error control, vars, scape on strings, and other ideas.

As the parser will generate the code from peg to parse itself... It's easy to keep updated the peg grammar used to parse from peg.

```peg
main            =   grammar

grammar         =   rule+

rule            =   _  symbol  _  "="  _  expr  _eol _

expr            =   or

or              =   and         ( _ "/" _  or  )*

and             =   rep_or_neg  ( _1 _ !(symbol _ "=") and )*


rep_or_neg      =   atom_or_par ("*" / "+" / "?")?
                /   "!" atom_or_par

atom_or_par     =   (atom / parenth)


parenth         =   "("  _  expr  _  ")"


atom            =   literal
                /   match
                /   dot
                /   symbol

literal         =   _"  (  "\\" .
                        /  !_" .
                        )*  _"
_"              =   "\""

symbol          =   [_'a-zA-Z0-9] [_'"a-zA-Z0-9]*

eol             =   ("\r\n"  /  "\n"  /  "\r")
_eol            =   " "*  eol

match           =   "["
                        (
                            (mchars+  mbetween*)
                            / mbetween+
                        )
                    "]"

mchars          =   (!"]" !(. "-") .)+
mbetween        =   (.  "-"  .)

dot             =   "."

_               =   (  " "
                        /   eol
                    )*

_1              =   (" " / eol)
```

## Parsing the parser

Or... how to parse yourself

Remember, we started with the concept of a simple parser...

Starting with a set of rules and the input to process, we will generate the `AST`

![simple_parser](./doc_images/simple_parser.png "Simple parser")

On this, we added an additional step to generate the rules from a `peg grammar`
avoiding written by hand on code.

Then, we have a parser that accepts `peg` grammars.

Now instead of giving the set of rules, we can provide a `peg` definition
and the input to genterate the `AST`

![basic_diagram](./doc_images/basic.png "Basic diagram")

But the `input peg` grammar has to be processed (parsed). We have to writte `rules_from_peg` code to parse the `input peg`

Who's gonna parse the grammar peg? A parser?

Let me think... Ummmm!!!

I'm a parser!!!!!

We have a feature that allows us to generate the Rust code for an `AST` tree generated from a `peg` grammar. Oh?!

So the code to parse the peg grammar will be generated automatically with this parser

![automatic_diagram](./doc_images/automatic_diagram.png "Automatic")

Then we will generate automatically `rules_from_peg` recursively.

Once this is done, we can now use the parser in a classic way

Remember, a normal parsing, we have two inputs.

1. The `peg grammar`
1. The input text

Now, for start with, both inputs will be a `peg grammar` defining it self (a `peg grammar` defining a `peg grammar`)

1. input: `peg grammar` defining itself
1. running `rules_from_peg` to generate a set of rules for this `peg grammar`
1. With the two previous points, we will parse creating the `AST` for the `peg grammar`
1. Now we will call `ast::genetarte_rust` to generate the code for `rules_from_peg`
1. We will insert this code on the parser
1. And we are ready to parse an `input` with a `peg grammar` to generate the `AST`

Why to do that?

First, it's possible and a great test.

Second. If we want to modify our `peg grammar`, it's boring and error
prone to write the code manually.

Using a `peg` file to generate automatically `rules_from_peg`, keeps
document and code as one (always synchronized)
